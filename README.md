## Record Store

Listen and Buy records in this online shop, powered by Spotify.

### About the project

The main objective from The Odin Project curriculum was to build a 'Shopping Cart' web application using
React and React Router, so I have to say that this project added some extra complexity with the use of Spotify Api.

The main challenge was making the API work properly, choosing the right Authorization Flow and proper routing. After some failed attemps i realized the 'Implicit Grant Flow' was the best choice for now, since is the only one that relies purely on Javascript, no need for backend knowledge.

The end result is pretty cool for know, you're able to login in to your Spotify Account and start looking for records.
